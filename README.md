# CS 230 Module Eight Journal: Software Design Document Reflection

## Brief Summary
The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their Android game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a **web-based, cross-platform game**. They needed multiplayer functionality with multiple teams and players, unique team/game names, and a single active game instance to prevent conflicts during play.

## What I Did Well
I organized the requirements, domain model, and architectural recommendations **clearly and simply**. I also selected AWS with a Linux architecture, explaining how it would help with **scalability, reliability, and cost management**.

## Helpful Parts of the Design Document Process
Working through the design document helped me **visualize how components interact**, making it easier to plan out code structure, data management, and security early on.

## What I Would Revise
I would expand the **System Architecture View** by adding a clear diagram showing AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3) connected to the game components for quick reference.

## Interpreting User Needs
I focused on cross-platform compatibility, multiplayer support, and scalable design to match the client’s needs. Considering user needs ensures the game is **functional, usable, and scalable**, helping the client achieve their business goals.

## Approach to Software Design
I broke down requirements, evaluated platform options, and chose an architecture aligned with the client’s goals. In future projects, I would use **UML diagrams earlier, research similar cases, and evaluate cost factors** to support design choices and improve scalability and user experience.
